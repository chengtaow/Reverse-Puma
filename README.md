# Reverse-Puma
Reverse kinematic analysis of Puma Robot in MATLAB

Run the main_reverse_puma program and give the following inputs:
```
S6 = 4;
tool_6 = [5; 3; 7];
tool_F = [24.112; 20.113; 18.167];
S6_F = [0.079; -0.787; 0.612];
a67_F = [0.997; 0.064; -0.047];
```
You will get 8 set of results and there is a forward puma function to check the results.
